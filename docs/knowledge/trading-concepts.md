    usage: "More responsive to price changes";
    example: "12-day, 26-day exponential moving averages";
  };
  weighted: {
    calculation: "Weighted average with linear weighting";
    usage: "Smoother than simple, more responsive than exponential";
    example: "20-day weighted moving average";
  };
}
```
