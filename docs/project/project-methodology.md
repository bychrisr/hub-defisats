# Project Methodology

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive project methodology for the Axisor trading automation platform development. It defines the development approach, processes, tools, and practices that guide the project from conception to deployment and ongoing maintenance.

## Methodology Framework

### Agile Development Approach

#### Core Principles
- **Individuals and Interactions**: Prioritizing people and communication over processes and tools
- **Working Software**: Delivering functional software over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer Collaboration**: Working closely with customers and stakeholders
- **Responding to Change**: Adapting to changing requirements and market conditions

#### Agile Manifesto Implementation
```typescript
// Agile Development Principles
interface AgilePrinciples {
  values: {
    individuals: "People and interactions over processes and tools";
    workingSoftware: "Working software over comprehensive documentation";
    customerCollaboration: "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation";
    respondingToChange: "Responding to change over following a plan";
  };
  practices: {
    iterative: "Iterative and incremental development";
    continuous: "Continuous integration and deployment";
    feedback: "Regular feedback and adaptation";
    collaboration: "Cross-functional team collaboration";
  };
}
```

### Scrum Framework

#### Scrum Roles
- **Product Owner**: Responsible for product vision, backlog management, and stakeholder communication
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates Scrum process, removes impediments, and ensures team adherence to Scrum practices
- **Development Team**: Self-organizing team responsible for delivering product increments

#### Scrum Events
- **Sprint Planning**: Planning sprint goals, backlog items, and tasks
- **Daily Standups**: Daily synchronization and progress updates
- **Sprint Review**: Demonstration of completed work to stakeholders
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Team reflection and process improvement

#### Scrum Artifacts
- **Product Backlog**: Prioritized list of features and requirements
- **Sprint Backlog**: Selected items for current sprint
- **Product Increment**: Working software delivered at sprint end

### Development Methodology

#### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

**Continuous Integration**
```typescript
// CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
interface CICDPipeline {
  integration: {
    sourceControl: "Git-based source control with branching strategy";
    automatedTesting: "Automated unit, integration, and E2E tests";
    codeQuality: "Automated code quality checks and linting";
    securityScanning: "Automated security vulnerability scanning";
  };
  deployment: {
    staging: "Automated deployment to staging environment";
    production: "Automated deployment to production with approval";
    rollback: "Automated rollback capabilities";
    monitoring: "Deployment monitoring and health checks";
  };
}
```

**Deployment Strategy**
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployment strategy
- **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollout of new features
- **Feature Flags**: Toggle features on/off without deployment
- **Automated Rollback**: Quick rollback in case of issues

#### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**TDD Process**
1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass the test
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests passing

**Testing Strategy**
```typescript
// Testing Pyramid
interface TestingStrategy {
  unit: {
    coverage: "90%+ code coverage";
    tools: "Jest, React Testing Library";
    focus: "Individual functions and components";
  };
  integration: {
    coverage: "API endpoints and service integration";
    tools: "Supertest, Prisma Mock";
    focus: "Component interaction and data flow";
  };
  e2e: {
    coverage: "Critical user journeys";
    tools: "Playwright, Cypress";
    focus: "End-to-end user workflows";
  };
}
```

#### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

**BDD Process**
- **Given**: Define the initial context and state
- **When**: Describe the action or event
- **Then**: Specify the expected outcome

**BDD Implementation**
```gherkin
# Example BDD Scenario
Feature: User Authentication
  Scenario: User can log in with valid credentials
    Given the user has a valid account
    When the user enters valid email and password
    Then the user should be redirected to the dashboard
    And the user should see their profile information
```

### Quality Assurance Methodology

#### Quality Gates
- **Code Quality**: Code review, linting, and quality metrics
- **Security**: Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- **Performance**: Performance testing and optimization
- **Usability**: User experience testing and validation
- **Compliance**: Regulatory compliance and audit requirements

#### Quality Metrics
```typescript
// Quality Assurance Metrics
interface QualityMetrics {
  codeQuality: {
    coverage: "90%+ test coverage";
    complexity: "Cyclomatic complexity < 10";
    duplication: "Code duplication < 5%";
    maintainability: "Maintainability index > 70";
  };
  performance: {
    responseTime: "API response time < 200ms";
    loadTime: "Page load time < 2 seconds";
    throughput: "Support 1000+ concurrent users";
    availability: "99.9% uptime";
  };
  security: {
    vulnerabilities: "Zero critical vulnerabilities";
    compliance: "100% regulatory compliance";
    encryption: "All data encrypted in transit and at rest";
    access: "Role-based access control";
  };
}
```
