## Build Process

### Build Configuration

#### Backend Build
```dockerfile
# backend/Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS base

# Install dependencies only when needed
FROM base AS deps
RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies based on the preferred package manager
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Rebuild the source code only when needed
FROM base AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Production image, copy all the files and run the app
FROM base AS runner
WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV=production

RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 axisor

COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules

      run: |
        kubectl set image deployment/axisor axisor=axisor:latest
        kubectl rollout status deployment/axisor
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Pipeline Monitoring

#### Monitoring Configuration
```yaml
# Pipeline monitoring
monitoring:
  metrics:
    - name: "build_duration"
      type: "histogram"
      description: "Build duration in seconds"
    
    - name: "test_duration"
      type: "histogram"
      description: "Test execution duration in seconds"
    
    - name: "deployment_duration"
      type: "histogram"
      description: "Deployment duration in seconds"
    
    - name: "pipeline_success_rate"
      type: "gauge"
      description: "Pipeline success rate percentage"

  alerts:
    - name: "pipeline_failure"
      condition: "pipeline_success_rate < 90"
      severity: "critical"
      notification: "slack"
    
    - name: "build_timeout"
      condition: "build_duration > 1800"
      severity: "warning"
      notification: "email"
```

### Alerting Rules

#### Alert Configuration
```yaml
# Alerting rules
alerts:
  - alert: PipelineFailure
    expr: pipeline_success_rate < 90
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Pipeline success rate is below 90%"
      description: "Pipeline success rate has been below 90% for 5 minutes"

  - alert: BuildTimeout
    expr: build_duration > 1800
    for: 2m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Build is taking longer than expected"
      description: "Build duration has exceeded 30 minutes"
```

## Best Practices

### CI/CD Best Practices

#### Pipeline Best Practices
```typescript
// CI/CD Best Practices
interface CICDBestPractices {
  pipeline: {
    fast_feedback: "Provide fast feedback to developers";
    reliability: "Ensure pipeline reliability and stability";
    maintainability: "Keep pipeline configuration maintainable";
    security: "Implement security best practices";
  };
  testing: {
    comprehensive: "Run comprehensive test suite";
    parallel: "Execute tests in parallel when possible";
    coverage: "Maintain high test coverage";
    quality: "Ensure test quality and reliability";
  };
  deployment: {
    automation: "Automate deployment processes";
    rollback: "Implement rollback strategies";
    monitoring: "Monitor deployment health";
    validation: "Validate deployment success";
  };
}
```

#### Security Best Practices
- **Secrets Management**: Use secure secret management
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls
- **Security Scanning**: Regular security scanning
- **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
- **Code Signing**: Sign code and artifacts
- **Audit Logging**: Maintain audit logs

#### Performance Best Practices
- **Build Optimization**: Optimize build processes
- **Caching**: Implement effective caching strategies
- **Parallel Execution**: Use parallel execution where possible
- **Resource Management**: Optimize resource usage
- **Monitoring**: Monitor pipeline performance

## Conclusion

This CI/CD pipeline provides a comprehensive approach to automated software delivery for the Axisor project. By following the guidelines and best practices outlined in this document, the team can ensure reliable, efficient, and secure software delivery.

Key principles for effective CI/CD:
- **Automation**: Maximize automation of build, test, and deployment processes
- **Quality**: Maintain high quality standards throughout the pipeline
- **Security**: Implement security best practices at every stage
- **Monitoring**: Monitor pipeline health and performance
- **Continuous Improvement**: Continuously improve pipeline processes

Remember that CI/CD is not just about automation, but about enabling rapid, reliable, and secure software delivery while maintaining high quality standards.
