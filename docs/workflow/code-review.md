  };
}
```

#### Comment Examples
```markdown
# Good Review Comments

## Specific and Actionable
"The error handling in this function could be improved. Consider adding a try-catch block around the database query to handle connection errors gracefully."

## Constructive Feedback
"This is a good approach, but we could make it more maintainable by extracting the validation logic into a separate function."

## Security Concern
"This function directly concatenates user input into a SQL query, which could lead to SQL injection. Consider using parameterized queries instead."

## Performance Suggestion
"This loop could be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm. The current approach has O(n²) complexity, but we could achieve O(n) with a hash map."

# Bad Review Comments

## Too Vague
"This doesn't look right."

## Not Constructive
"This is wrong."

## No Context
"Fix this."

## Personal Attack
"This is terrible code."
```
