### Quality Gates

#### Quality Gate Configuration
```typescript

      coverage: "> 80%";
      duplication: "< 3%";
      maintainability: "> 70";
    };
    eslint: {
      errors: 0;
      warnings: "< 10";
      style: "Consistent";
    };
  };
  test_quality: {
    unit_tests: {
      coverage: "> 90%";
      reliability: "> 95%";
      performance: "< 5 minutes";
    };
    integration_tests: {
      coverage: "> 80%";
      reliability: "> 90%";
      performance: "< 10 minutes";
    };
    e2e_tests: {
      coverage: "> 70%";
      reliability: "> 85%";
      performance: "< 15 minutes";
    };
  };

      outdated: "< 10%";
      vulnerable: 0;
    };
  };
}
```

## Testing Procedures

### Test Planning

#### Test Strategy
```typescript
// Test Strategy
interface TestStrategy {
  unit_testing: {
    scope: "Individual functions and components";
    coverage: "90% of code lines";
    execution: "Fast execution (< 5 minutes)";
    reliability: "High reliability (> 95%)";
  };
  integration_testing: {
    scope: "Component interactions and APIs";
    coverage: "80% of integration points";
    execution: "Medium execution (< 10 minutes)";
    reliability: "High reliability (> 90%)";
  };
  e2e_testing: {
    scope: "End-to-end user workflows";
    coverage: "70% of critical paths";
    execution: "Slower execution (< 15 minutes)";
    reliability: "Medium reliability (> 85%)";
  };
  performance_testing: {
    scope: "System performance under load";
    coverage: "Critical performance scenarios";
    execution: "Variable execution time";
    reliability: "High reliability (> 90%)";
  };
}
```

#### Test Planning Process

2. **Test Design**: Design comprehensive test cases
3. **Test Implementation**: Implement test cases
4. **Test Execution**: Execute tests and collect results
5. **Test Reporting**: Generate test reports and metrics
6. **Test Maintenance**: Maintain and update tests

### Test Execution

#### Test Execution Strategy
```typescript
// Test Execution Strategy
interface TestExecution {
  automated: {
    unit_tests: "Run on every commit";
    integration_tests: "Run on every pull request";
    e2e_tests: "Run on every merge to main";
    performance_tests: "Run on every release";
  };
  manual: {
    exploratory: "Exploratory testing for new features";
